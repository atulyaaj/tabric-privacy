# Privacy Policy

**Tabric** (“Extension,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a browser extension that allows users to save and restore browser sessions. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information in connection with the Extension.

**Effective date:** February 3, 2026

## 1. Information We Store Locally

The Extension stores the following information **only on your device** using your browser’s local storage. We do not transmit this information to our servers or any third party (except as stated in Section 3 below).

| Data type | Purpose | Retention |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Saved sessions (names, notes, tab URLs and titles) | To let you save, restore, and manage sessions | Until you delete them or uninstall the Extension |
| Drafts (unsaved text in Save Session and Feedback forms) | To restore your input if you close and reopen the form | Automatically deleted after **24 hours** |
| Theme preference (e.g., light/dark mode) | To remember your display preference | Until you change it or uninstall the Extension |

All of the above is stored solely in your browser’s local storage and is not collected or processed by us on our systems.

## 2. What We Do Not Do

- We **do not** collect, transmit, or store your sessions, tab data, or notes on any server we control.
- We **do not** use analytics, tracking, or advertising in the Extension.
- We **do not** sell or share your data with third parties for marketing or profiling.

---

## 3. Feedback and Email Disclosure

If you voluntarily use the in-Extension **Feedback** form:

- The **message content** and any **email address** you choose to provide are sent to the developer via **EmailJS**, a third-party email delivery service.
- Only the information you enter in that form is sent. Your saved sessions, tab lists, and other locally stored data are **not** included.
- This is the only circumstance in which data you provide is transmitted outside your device. By submitting feedback, you consent to this transmission.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

- **EmailJS** is used solely to deliver feedback messages to the developer. Their handling of data is governed by their own privacy policy ([emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)).
- The Extension does not otherwise integrate third-party analytics or tracking.

---

## 5. Your Choices and Data Deletion

- You may **delete individual sessions** at any time from within the Extension.
- **Drafts** are automatically removed after 24 hours; you can also clear them by clearing the form and closing the Extension.
- **Uninstalling the Extension** removes all locally stored data (sessions, drafts, and settings) from your device.

We do not retain copies of your local data once it is deleted or the Extension is uninstalled.

---

## 6. Data Security

Data stored by the Extension remains on your device and is subject to your browser’s and device’s security. When you submit feedback, that content is transmitted over the internet to EmailJS and then to the developer; such transmission uses standard HTTPS.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” at the top will be revised when we do. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For material changes, we encourage you to review the policy on this page periodically.
